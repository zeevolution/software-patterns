# Introduction to Software Design Architecture

In this chapter, we are going to study the basics of software design architecture based on the book [`Introdução à Arquitetura de Design de Software`](https://www.amazon.com.br/Introdu%C3%A7%C3%A3o-%C3%A0-Arquitetura-Design-Software/dp/8535250298) by Paulo Silveira.

I chose that book because it is best reading I have ever had on the subject while I was striving to improve my software development skills as a young software engineer.

The book uses the Java Platform for its software development approach, so we are going to do the same as well.

In here, we are going to following chapters covered by the book:

- [Introduction to Software Design Architecture](#)
- [The Java Platform](#)
- [The Java Virtual Machine](#)
- [Object Oriented Programming Topics](#)
- [Software Responsibilities](#)
- [Tests and Automation](#)
