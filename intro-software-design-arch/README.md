# Introduction to Software Design Architecture

In here, we are going to study the basics of software design architecture based on the book [`Introdução à Arquitetura de Design de Software`](https://www.amazon.com.br/Introdu%C3%A7%C3%A3o-%C3%A0-Arquitetura-Design-Software/dp/8535250298) by Paulo Silveira.

I chose this book because it is the best reading I had ever had on the subject while I was striving to improve my software development skills as a young software engineer.

The book uses the Java Platform for its software development approach, so we are going to do the same as well.

Next, we are going to follow the same chapters covered by the book:
